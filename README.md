# Smart Reader for Visually Impaired People

Having a proper and quality education is very important for all of us. So how can visually impaired people who cannot benefit from books, which are humanity's wealth of knowledge, have a good education?

Nowadays computer technologies are developing rapidly and makes people's lives easier. Smart tools powered by computer technologies can make with appropriate software and hardware parts things that people have difficulty doing or cannot do at all. We hope to solve the problem of visually impaired people not being able to read books or being addicted to the Braille alphabet with a smart device that can convert text to sound and is easy to carry and use.
